							<p>
								<span>Son of Achilles, Neoptolemus,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sprung from the noblest of the Grecian host,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This is the beach of Lemnos, sea-girt isle,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A land untrod, untenanted, where once,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As bidden by the chiefs, I put ashore</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Malian, son of Poeas, grievously</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Afflicted by his foot’s envenomed wound.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For us there was no peace at sacrifice</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or at libations, but the whole camp rang</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With his discordant screams and savage yells,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Moaning and groaning. But what skills it now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To tell this tale? No time for large discourse</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That might betray our presence and undo</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The plot I’ve laid to catch him presently.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To work! it rests with thee to play thy part,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And help me to discover hereabouts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A cave with double mouth by nature made</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To catch on either side the winter sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or by the breeze that through the archway blows</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Invite in summer’s heat to gentle sleep;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And lower down, a little to the left,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A spring, if still it flows, thou art like to find.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Go warily to work and bring me word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whether he still is there or further gone.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That done, thy part will be to listen, mine</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To instruct, that both may gain our common end.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Of whose disastrous plight no rumour yet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath reached my home or any Grecian land!</span>
								<br/>

								<br/>
								<span>Rankles, and daily grows from bad to worse.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O boy, O son sprung from Achilles’ loins,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am that man, of whom thou mayst have heard,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Heritor of the bow of Heracles,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The son of Poeas, Philoctetes, whom</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Atridae and the Cephallenian prince</span>
								<br/>

								<br/>
								<span>Plague-stricken, wasting slowly, marked for death</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By a man-slaying serpent’s venomous fangs.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus plagued, my son, they left me here, what time</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their fleet from sea-girt Chrysè touched this shore.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tired with long tossing I had fallen asleep</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beneath a rock upon the beach; they laughed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To see me witless, laughed and sailed away,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Flinging me, as they went, some cast-off rags,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A beggar’s alms, and scraps of food. God grant</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That they may some day come to fare like me!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Picture, my son, when I awoke and found</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All gone, what waking then was mine; what tears,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What lamentations, when I saw the ships</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In which I sailed all vanished; not a soul</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To share my solitude or tend my wound.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All ways I gazed and nothing found but pain,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pain, and of pain, God wot, enow, my son.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So passed the crawling hours, day upon day,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Year after year. I shifted for myself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beneath this homeless, solitary roof.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To sate my hunger with this bow I shot</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The wingèd doves and ever when my bolt</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sped from the taut string to the mark, I crawled</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thither my lamed foot trailing painfully.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And if of water I had need, or when</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In winter time the ground was hoar with frost,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And firewood must be fetched, forth would I creep</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Somewise to compass this. I had no fire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But from the hard rock striking flint on flint</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Brought forth the hidden spark that keeps me alive.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For, look ye, a bare roof and fire withal</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Serve all my needs, save healing of my sore.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Now let me tell thee of this isle, my son.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No mariner sails hither of his will,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For anchorage is none, nor mart whereat</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He may find lodging and exchange his wares</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For profit; prudent men sail not this way.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet a stray visitor⁠—such accidents</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Must happen in long years⁠—puts in perforce.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From such, my son, when they do come, I get</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Kind words of pity and perchance an alms</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of food or raiment, but at the first hint</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of passage home, they one and all refuse.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So here for ten long years I linger on,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Consumed with hunger, dying inch by inch;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Only the worm that gnaws me dieth not.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To the Atridae and Odysseus, boy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I owe this misery. God in heaven requite</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In kind the wrongs that they have done to me!</span>

								<span>There lay my sire in death, and I, poor fool,</span>

								<span>To the Atridae as my natural friends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Claiming my sire’s arms and what else was his.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O ’twas a sorry answer that they made:</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Is thine and welcome⁠—all except his arms;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>These to Laertes’ son have been assigned.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I wept, I started to my feet in wrath,</span>

								<span>And bitterly I spake, “O tyrannous men,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How dare ye give these arms, my own by right,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My leave unasked, to any man but me?”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then said Odysseus who was standing by,</span>

								<span>“Yes, boy, and rightly are they given to me,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who rescued both their master and his arms.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>

								<span>Who would defraud me of my rightful arms.</span>

								<span>He, though not choleric, challenged thus direct,</span>

								<span>Chiefest of seers, who plainly prophesied</span>

								<span>His life the forfeit if his word proved false.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>As bravest of the host, and, first made whole</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By healing hands, as conqueror of Troy,</span>
